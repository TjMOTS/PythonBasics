# PythonBasics

I'm learning Python! 

Python is case-sensitive.

REPL is started by running `python` or `python3`. To exit out of the REPL, run `CTRL-D`.

To run a program thru the python interpreter run 

```python

python3 hello.py

```

Assign variables just by naming them in snake-case like this

```python

first_name = "Frank"
print(first_name, "is learning Python!")

```

Ask input from the user by using 

```python

first_name = input("What is your first name? ")
print(first_name, "is learning Python!")

```

Naming things is hard. Here are [Pythons's naming conventions][pythonNamingConventio].
